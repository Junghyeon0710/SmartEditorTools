   *Click a level to load it in the editor*

5. **Load the Level**

   Selecting a level from the list will load that level in the editor.

## Tips & Notes

- Make sure Unreal Editor is running in **Editor mode**. Levels won’t load if the game is in Play mode.
- Only levels added to **Editor Maps** will appear in the combo box.
- If the widget does not display properly, check that the SmartEditorTools plugin is **enabled**.
- Avoid using special characters or extremely long names for levels to prevent issues with loading.
